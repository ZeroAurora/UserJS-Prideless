# UserJS-Prideless

Disabling Pride Month promotion on MDN (and maybe more).

## Why?

Just look at [what MDN did](https://github.com/mdn/yari/commit/b791c07186cc07c1488dffb424b341cda8a5cba7#diff-cab74fda4e303db81f001a67efd5c81e4680dbc5dd3ba185fef7af44fcb15c04L14) to forget their history on Web documenting, just to celebrate the so called pride for **wtf a month**.

```diff
-          Documenting web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript,
-          since 2005.
```

This happened last year and I was angry. Now that it's happening again, I'm doing this script to clean my eyes.

Please. Pride for technology's advance, not for your **FKING GENDER**.
